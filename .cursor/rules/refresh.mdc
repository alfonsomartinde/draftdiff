Diagnose and resolve the issue described above using a systematic, validation-driven approach:

1. **Collect Precise Context**:
   - Gather all relevant details: error messages, logs, stack traces, and observed behaviors tied to the issue.
   - Use `grep_search` for exact terms (e.g., function names) or `codebase_search` for broader context.
   - Trace the data flow or execution path to define the issue's boundaries.
   - Verify the issue's location within the Hexagonal Architecture layers.

2. **Investigate Root Causes**:
   - List at least three plausible causes, spanning code logic, dependencies, or configuration.
   - Validate each using `cat -n <file path>` to inspect code with line numbers.
   - Confirm or rule out hypotheses by cross-referencing execution paths.

3. **Reuse Existing Patterns**:
   - Search the codebase with `codebase_search` for prior fixes or similar issues.
   - Identify reusable utilities or error-handling strategies.
   - Check `shared/` directory for common error handling patterns.
   - Validate reuse candidates against the current issue's specifics.

4. **Analyze Impact**:
   - Trace all affected dependencies to assess the issue's scope.
   - Determine if it's a localized bug or a symptom of a broader design flaw.
   - Highlight potential side effects on performance or maintainability.
   - Consider impact on accessibility (WCAG2.2) and internationalization.

5. **Propose Targeted Fixes**:
   - Suggest specific, minimal changes with file paths and line numbers.
   - Justify each fix with clear reasoning.
   - Ensure fixes follow project conventions:
     * Components: PascalCase
     * Utilities: camelCase
     * Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
   - Avoid broad refactoring unless explicitly requested.

6. **Validate and Monitor**:
   - Outline test cases for normal, edge, and failure scenarios.
   - Use framework specific Testing Library for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests.
   - Follow test patterns:
     * Mock only what is necessary
   - Ensure 80%+ test coverage for modified code.

7. **Test Environment Safety**:
   - Never modify `process.env` directly in tests
   - Ensure test isolation by restoring all spies and mocks
   - Design tests to work correctly in parallel execution
   - Clean up environment modifications to prevent test pollution

8. **Debugging Best Practices**:
   - Use console.log strategically for debugging
   - Verify mock configurations are correct
   - Check that expectations match actual behavior
   - Isolate issues in specific tests
   - Verify the order of operations
   - Document the debugging process
   - Keep track of common solutions

9. **State Management**:
   - Clean state between tests
   - Restore original environment variables
   - Verify mocks don't affect other tests
   - Use `beforeEach` for setup and `afterEach` for cleanup
   - Document test dependencies
   - Avoid shared state between tests
   - Verify state is properly restored

10. **Documentation**:
    - Explain each test's purpose
    - Document non-obvious test cases
    - Explain mock configuration
    - Document state management
    - Explain expectations
    - Document debugging process
    - Keep documentation updated

This process ensures a thorough, efficient resolution that strengthens the codebase while directly addressing the reported issue.
